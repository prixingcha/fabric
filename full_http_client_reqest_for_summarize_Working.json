has put plans for a giant chip factory in the eastern city of magor on hold the 30 billion Euro project would have created 3,000 jobs and provided a major boost to a region that\\u0026#39;s traditionally lagged behind the rest of the country to talk more about this I\\u0026#39;m joined Now by Professor Mel tum director of the drin branch of the eepo economic research institute great to talk to you Professor to now we knew in had been struggling but how surprised were you to hear that magnor was to fall victim to its cost cutting yeah it was certainly a big surprise uh even though the the problems of Intel were well known and it was pretty clear that some projects would be put on hold so that it\\u0026#39;s murg that\\u0026#39;s a bit of a surprise but that the some cost cutting was necessary on Intel side that\\u0026#39;s not a big surprise why do you think they chose mbook as the focus of this these Cuts though well it\\u0026#39;s it\\u0026#39;s one of the projects that is not already uh on its way uh it\\u0026#39;s much easier if you do not have to lay off people people haven\\u0026#39;t been hired at least not on a big scale uh and so that was probably one of the the easiest way to save costs in the next few years and on a very in a very short period of so other other projects might take much longer until they become cost effective this maret book chip plant was to be part of a big Investment Drive in the former East Germany a region that\\u0026#39;s been hopefully dubbed the Silicon Saxony describe to me just what Intel decision means for the people of this region yeah for the for the region it\\u0026#39;s certainly uh bad news for uh two reasons uh the first reason is uh that this investment promise uh new and fairly well-paid jobs and as you know Eastern Germany is still lagging behind in in terms of of wages compared to Western Germany and so this investment would have been uh at least one element in this convergence process and the second reason is that it creates uncertainty so we do not know what will happen in two years and now everything probably stopped every all the planning is stopped and and but you can\\u0026#39;t make alternative plans because maybe in two years you still need this area for the pond maybe you don\\u0026#39;t need it um so it creates uncertainty and that\\u0026#39;s certainly bad for uh investments in this region so yeah you\\u0026#39;re in a kind of extended limbo aren\\u0026#39;t you now we reached out to Intel and they pointed us to an email that CEO Pat Ginger had written to staff it includes the lines we recently increased our capacity in Europe through our new Fabs in Ireland which will remain our lead European hub for the foreseeable future now it went on to explain that projects in Poland and Germany would be put on hold for around two years depending on market demand how would you interpret the decision to prioritize the small country of Ireland over Germany and Poland is this a tax based decision I don\\u0026#39;t think it\\u0026#39;s um it depends on some kind of qualities of the area that\\u0026#39;s probably not the reason I guess um Intel has already been present in in Ireland uh it\\u0026#39;s probably much easier to be there because of of the language uh that has always been an advantage of Ireland I don\\u0026#39;t think it\\u0026#39;s a decision against Germany or against Poland it\\u0026#39;s uh just a decision that this was the most basically the most flexible project you mentioned the workers there did mag deug have the people um to to supply the this demand in the factory or were they hoping to bring in a lot of talent from abroad U that\\u0026#39;s a very good point um so unemployment in Eastern Germany has decreased enormously when you compare it to say 20 years ago 2000 2005 uh so the the unemployment isn\\u0026#39;t much much bigger uh compared to regions in West Germany so that\\u0026#39;s not the main reason but what we probably would have seen is that people move from other places to M book so it would bring in new mostly skilled labor into the region and it would allow people in the region to move from their current uh company to a new company to to Intel that probably pays better and that\\u0026#39;s that\\u0026#39;s one of the main mechanisms how wages in a region are driven up that people move from one job to a better paid job and that won\\u0026#39;t happen now so uh for uh the wage development in the region it\\u0026#39;s it\\u0026#39;s certainly bad news and there could potentially be a slight Silver Lining to this story and that is because the German government has committed to 10 billion euros in subsidies to this project money that could now be used to fill the large hole in its budget there seem to be differing views within the government though about whether the funds can actually be reallocated can you explain why the idea of this is so complicated so so first of all it\\u0026#39;s it\\u0026#39;s probably good news for the for the public budget because Germany has promised around 10 billion euros of subsidies and uh many economists have warned that this is probably not the best way to develop an economy just by paying huge subsidies to a small number of big players rather than developing the economy in a more broader scope and so the the good news is that there\\u0026#39;s money available especially in times when the budget is very tight and and there uh big conflicts over how to uh to to close this Gap in the budget and there are simply certain interests so the Finance Minister uh wants to reduce the the budget deficit and uh the the minister for the economy wants uh to develop his projects further so he wants that this money is used for climate related projects so that\\u0026#39;s just a conflict Within government and well they have to discuss that now Germany\\u0026#39;s economy Minister Robert harck says the Intel setback won\\u0026#39;t change the government\\u0026#39;s plans to build up chip production in Europe your colleague Clemens F the head of the EO Research Institute had been critical of the government providing such generous subsidies to Intel if subsidies are not the answer what should the government be doing to attract chip producers yeah I\\u0026#39;m not even sure that it\\u0026#39;s a good idea to attract uh chip producers specifically um I think it\\u0026#39;s often neglected in this debate that the semiconductor industry uh needs an enormous supply chain so just having a semiconductor fab here uh in Germany doesn\\u0026#39;t mean that we\\u0026#39;re more independent in case of a crisis in case of a conflict with China so we we would still need many any inputs to produce uh the semiconductors even when they\\u0026#39;re produced here this is not the final product you need others in this value chain to basically refine the product to make it a a final product and then it\\u0026#39;s not even clear even if the factories here whether these chips are really used within Europe so I think there are many uncertainties associated with attracting these factories they\\u0026#39;re extremely expensive and not clear uh that we become more kind of self-sufficient in terms of uh future Technologies all right Professor Mel tum from the eepo economic research institute thank you so much thank you goodbye \"\n}"
